Zig Zag Traversal Of Binary Tree


0

Problem Statement: Given a Binary Tree, print the zigzag traversal of the Binary Tree. Zigzag traversal of a binary tree is a way of visiting the nodes of the tree in a zigzag pattern, alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left at each level.

Examples

Input:Binary Tree: 1 2 3 4 5 -1 6

Output: [[1],[3, 2],[4, 5, 6]]
Explanation: 

Level 1 (Root): Visit the root node 1 from left to right. Zigzag Traversal: [1]
Level 2: Visit nodes at this level in a right-to-left order. Zigzag Traversal:  [1], [3, 2]
Level 3: Visit nodes at this level in a left-to-right order. Zigzag Traversal:  [1], [3, 2], [4, 5, 6]

Input:
Binary Tree: 1 2 -1 4 5 -1 -1 7 8

Output :
 [[1], [2], [4, 5], [8, 7]]
Explanation: 
Level 1 (Root): Visit the root node 1 from left to right. Zigzag Traversal: [1]
Level 2: Visit nodes at this level in a right-to-left order. Zigzag Traversal:  [1], [2]
Level 3: Visit nodes at this level in a left-to-right order. Zigzag Traversal:  [1], [3, 2], [4, 5]
Level 4: Visit nodes at this level in a right-to-left order. Zigzag Traversal:  [1], [3, 2], [4, 5], [8, 7]
